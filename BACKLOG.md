# Backlog

Queued work for upcoming releases. Items at the top are highest-priority /
next-up. When picking something up, move it to a release in `CHANGELOG.ts`
(via the changelog protocol in `CLAUDE.md`) and delete it from this list.

This is intentionally informal — a running list of "things we want, in
roughly the order we want them." No tickets, no story points. If an item
needs detail, add a sub-bullet underneath it.

## Next up

- **New-user onboarding instructions.** A single document new engineers
  (and the IT / admin person setting them up) can read end-to-end to go
  from "I have an Altronic email" to "I can fully use the app." Put it
  somewhere both end users and admins can find it — likely a new
  `docs/ONBOARDING.md` at the repo root and a "Getting started" section
  in the in-app User Manual (`src/views/ManualView.tsx`) that summarises
  the user-facing parts.

  Cover at minimum:
  - **SharePoint site access.** Which site each list lives on, the AD /
    Entra group memberships the user needs to read + write each list
    (Project Task List, Projects, Test Results, EIRs, Admins). What the
    admin runs to grant access. How to verify access before opening the
    app.
  - **Shared mailbox permissions** for the @-mention + Report-issue
    email features. Specifically: the user needs **Send-As + FullAccess**
    (with `-AutoMapping:$false`) on `automation@altronic-llc.com`.
    Include the exact PowerShell one-liner IT can run for a new user:
    ```powershell
    Add-RecipientPermission automation@altronic-llc.com -Trustee NEW.USER@altronic-llc.com -AccessRights SendAs -Confirm:$false
    Add-MailboxPermission   automation@altronic-llc.com -User    NEW.USER@altronic-llc.com -AccessRights FullAccess -AutoMapping:$false
    ```
    Document *why* both are required (Send-As alone fails Graph's
    delegated sendMail; see CLAUDE.md's @-mention section).
  - **Entra app consent.** What the user sees on first sign-in (the
    Microsoft consent prompt listing User.Read, Sites.Selected,
    Mail.Send.Shared, etc.), what to click, what to do if their tenant
    has admin-consent-required and the prompt is blocked.
  - **First-use checklist.** Open the app, sign in, hit the Dashboard,
    create a test task, comment with an @-mention, confirm the mention
    email arrives — a one-page "does it work" walkthrough.
  - **What goes wrong + how to self-diagnose.** Point at the in-app
    "Report issue" button (life-buoy icon), explain it captures console
    errors automatically. Common symptoms (loading hangs = sign-in
    issue, mention email didn't arrive = Send-As/FullAccess missing,
    etc.) and their fixes.

  Once written, link it from the README, the in-app Footer "Help" area,
  and reference it from CLAUDE.md so future Claude sessions know where
  to look.

- **Catch-up notification on app open.** When a user lands on the app
  after being away, surface a short "while you were gone" summary —
  new tasks assigned to them, new comments on items they're watching,
  EIRs that changed status, and anything @-mentioning them. Driven by
  the user's last-seen timestamp (stored per-user, probably in
  `localStorage` keyed by email + bumped on every full app load) and
  the `lastModifiedDateTime` already on every Task / EIR / comment.
  Render as a dismissible banner under the header on the Dashboard
  with deep links into the affected items. Avoid emails for this —
  this is the "I came back to the app" recap, not a push.

- **PWA installable.** Wire the app so users can install it from the
  browser (Edge "Apps" / Chrome "Install" / mobile "Add to Home
  Screen"). Concrete steps: add `public/manifest.webmanifest` with
  name, short_name, theme + background colour (Cooper Red on white),
  icons (192/512 PNG + maskable), `display: "standalone"`,
  `start_url: "/altronic-engineering-tasks/"`,
  `scope: "/altronic-engineering-tasks/"`. Link from `index.html`,
  add `<meta name="theme-color">`. Register a minimal service worker
  (consider `vite-plugin-pwa` — handles manifest + SW + auto-update
  pattern cleanly) with a network-first strategy for Graph calls and
  cache-first for the built assets. Verify Lighthouse PWA score and
  the install prompt appears in Edge on a fresh visit. Don't bother
  with offline mode for SharePoint data yet — installable + chrome-
  less window is the goal, offline-first is a separate, much bigger
  effort.

## Later

- **ECN list integration.** Wire the ECN (Engineering Change Notice)
  SharePoint list into the app, similar to how EIRs and Test Sheets are
  wired today: a list view, a detail page, optimistic CRUD via Graph,
  inclusion in the Engineering Requests dropdown, and an entry in the
  About-page data model.

  **Blocker:** the ECN list + its underlying SharePoint site haven't
  been migrated yet. Pick this up once the migration is complete.

  **First step when picked up:** run the discovery PowerShell (list id +
  columns + sample item) so we can build `src/types/ecn.ts`,
  `src/lib/ecnMapper.ts`, and `src/api/ecns.ts` against the actual
  schema. Mirror the EIR pattern (`src/lib/eirMapper.ts`,
  `src/api/eirs.ts`, `src/views/EirsView.tsx`) — it's the closest
  analogue and most things will line up structurally.

## Done / shipped

When an item ships, move it into the corresponding CHANGELOG entry in
`src/data/changelog.ts` and delete it from this file. Don't keep a
"shipped" section here — the changelog is the record of what's done.

## Followups from the v0.2.0 batch

These are not formal backlog items, but flagging in case you want to track
them after a real-mode shakedown:

- **Comment race condition.** The `Communication` field is a single text
  blob that we read, prepend to, and write back. Two users commenting on
  the same task within ~500ms of each other can produce a lost-update
  where one comment overwrites the other. Same issue affects the Power
  App (same field, same write pattern), so this is not a regression. The
  "show me if someone else commented" feature in the Next-up section
  addresses this by making the conflict visible. A more durable fix
  would be either etag-based optimistic concurrency or moving comments
  to a separate SharePoint list — both bigger lifts.
- **Verify the parent-task field's actual internal name** in SharePoint.
  The mapper assumes `ParentTaskLookupId`; if the column is named
  something else (e.g. `Parent_x0020_Task_x0020_ReferLookupId`), update
  `src/lib/taskMapper.ts` and the GraphItemFields typedef.
- **Verify the multi-value related-projects field's internal name** —
  currently assumed to be `ProjectReference`. If it's not, same edits as
  above plus `ProjectReference` references throughout.
- **Verify the Software Revision field's internal name** in SharePoint.
  Currently assumed to be `SoftwareRevision`. Power App labels it
  "Software Revision" but the column's internal name may differ.
- **Verify the projects-list ID** and set `VITE_SP_PROJECTS_LIST_ID`. Run
  the lookup-discovery PowerShell snippet from CLAUDE.md once the parent
  app registration is in place.
- **Upload attachments to a SharePoint document library** in real mode.
  Today attachments are in-memory only (mock mode behavior). When the
  storage rules are decided, add the upload step inside `addComment` in
  `src/api/tasks.ts` — the `attachments` argument is already plumbed
  through; just needs the upload-to-SharePoint code.
- **Replace hardcoded admin allow-list** with SharePoint group
  membership. See `src/hooks/useIsAdmin.ts` for the current approach
  and TODO comment.
