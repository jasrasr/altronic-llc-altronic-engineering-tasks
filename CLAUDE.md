# Claude Code instructions for this repository

This file is the working manual for Claude Code when iterating on this app.
Read it before making non-trivial changes.

## What this app is

A web-based viewer and editor for the Altronic Engineering team's SharePoint
"Project Task List". Two views — List (default) and Kanban — sit over the
same underlying data. Hosted on GitHub Pages, authenticated per-user via
Microsoft Entra ID, reads/writes via Microsoft Graph.

## The mock/real boundary

The single most important architectural rule:

> **Every API call goes through `src/api/tasks.ts`, which branches on
> `USE_MOCK` (from `src/api/config.ts`).**

`USE_MOCK` is `true` by default and `false` when `VITE_USE_MOCK=false` in
the environment. No other file should care which mode it's in.

When adding a new operation (e.g. updating attachments):
1. Add the function to `src/api/tasks.ts`.
2. In the function, do `if (USE_MOCK) { ...mock impl... } else { ...graph impl... }`.
3. Add a React Query hook in `src/hooks/useTasks.ts`.
4. Use the hook from components.

This pattern keeps the mock and real implementations explicit, side by side,
in one place — easy to compare, easy to keep in sync.

## Backlog (`BACKLOG.md`)

Queued work that hasn't been picked up yet lives in `BACKLOG.md` at the
repo root. It's an informal running list — no tickets, no points.

**When the user asks to "queue something up" or "add to the list":**
1. Open `BACKLOG.md`.
2. Add a new item under `## Next up` (or `## Later` if they say so).
3. Use a short title + a sub-paragraph of context if helpful.
4. Do NOT make a code change for the item — just record it.
5. Commit the BACKLOG.md update on its own with a message like
   `docs: queue <thing> in backlog`. No changelog entry needed for
   backlog edits — they describe future work, not shipped work.

**When the user asks to pick something up from the backlog or work on
"the next thing":**
1. Open `BACKLOG.md` and pick the top item under `## Next up`.
2. Implement it following the normal protocol (changelog entry +
   matching commit message).
3. Delete the item from `BACKLOG.md` in the SAME commit.
4. The commit message and changelog entry describe what was built; the
   `BACKLOG.md` delete is automatic cleanup.

Never leave items in both places. The changelog records what shipped;
the backlog records what hasn't.

## Changelog protocol (REQUIRED on every change)

The app shows its current version in the footer, with a "View history" modal
that lists all releases. This is driven by `src/data/changelog.ts`.

**Every time you make a user-visible change, you MUST do both of these:**

### 1. Add a changelog entry

1. Open `src/data/changelog.ts`.
2. Add a new entry at the **top** of the `CHANGELOG` array (newest first).
3. Bump the version using semver-lite:
   - PATCH (0.1.0 → 0.1.1): bug fix, copy change, small UI polish
   - MINOR (0.1.x → 0.2.0): new feature (added view, new editor, etc.)
   - MAJOR (1.x.x → 2.0.0): rework, breaking data-model changes
4. Use today's date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
5. Write each change as a one-liner from the user's POV (not "refactored
   useTasks hook" but "tasks now reload after a network blip").
6. Group related changes in one entry. If you're only making one tiny
   fix, that's still its own entry.

### 2. Use the same content in the commit message

The Git commit message must mirror the changelog entry so the Git log
stays readable without opening the app. Format:

```
v<version>: <short summary>

- <change 1>
- <change 2>
- <change 3>
```

The short summary is a one-line description that fits in the 50-char
GitHub commit-list column. The bullet list below is the SAME bullets you
just put in `CHANGELOG`. Example:

```
v0.2.0: add person picker for task assignment

- Add user dropdown when editing a task's Assigned field
- Show current assignees as removable chips on the detail page
- Fix Kanban card text wrapping for long assignee lists
```

When you run `git commit`, use the multi-line `-m` syntax or write the
message in `git commit -F-` heredoc style so the bullets are preserved.
Do NOT collapse everything onto one line.

**Skip the changelog AND short-form the commit** only for: internal-only
refactors with zero behavior change, dependency bumps without user impact,
comment edits, typo fixes in code comments. For these, a one-line commit
like `chore: tidy useTasks comments` is fine and no changelog entry needed.
When in doubt, do the full protocol — it's free.

The footer reads `CURRENT_VERSION` automatically, so bumping the top entry
of `CHANGELOG` is the only place you need to change the version itself.

## File-by-file overview

Keep this current when adding/removing files (see "Architectural changes"
below). Tests live next to their source as `*.test.ts(x)` and are omitted here.

### EIR list views (workflow tabs)

`EirsView` has a **View** tab bar above the status pills, driven by a `view`
URL param. The bucket predicate is `matchesEirView(eir, view)` (exported from
`EirsView.tsx`, unit-tested):

- **All** — no extra filter.
- **New** — no project reference AND no engineer assigned (fresh, needs triage).
- **Needs Assigned** — has a project reference but still no engineer assigned.

Views compose with the status pills and the filter bar; all three axes live in
the URL so a view is shareable. To add another view: extend the `EirView` union
+ `matchesEirView` predicate, add a `<ViewTab>`, and document it here and in the
EIRs section of `ManualView.tsx`.

## Data model

The source of truth for field names and shapes is `src/types/task.ts`. The
SharePoint internal column names (which is what Graph returns under
`item.fields`) are:

| Domain field | SharePoint internal name | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | (from `item.id`, not fields) | Numeric string in Graph, parsed to int |
| `title` | `Title` | |
| `numberedTitle` | `NumberedTitle` | Writable text column, but the app owns it: format `T{n}-{projectRef}-{title}` where n = count of tasks already under the chosen project + 1. Form computes it; `createTask` writes it. |
| `description` | `Description` | HTML or plain text |
| `status` | `Status` | One of `STATUSES` |
| `priority` | `Priority` | One of `PRIORITIES`, nullable |
| `category` | `Category` | One of `CATEGORIES`, nullable |
| `labels` | `Labels` | Multi-choice, parsed from `;#` delimited string |
| `dueDate` | `DueDate` | ISO 8601 string |
| `assigned` | `Assigned` | Person-or-group (single or multi), shape varies |
| `watchers` | `Watchers` | Multi-person |
| `parentProject` | `Parent_x0020_Project_x0020_ReferLookupId` | Lookup, see below |
| `comments` | `Communication` | Pipe-delimited records, parsed in `communicationParser.ts` |
| `hasAttachments` | `Attachments` | Boolean |

### Allowed values (from PowerShell discovery)

- **Status:** `BACKLOG`, `SELECTED FOR DEVELOPMENT`, `In Progress`, `On Hold`, `Blocked`, `Complete`
- **Priority:** `Low`, `Medium`, `High`
- **Category:** Software, Hardware, UI, Drawing, Documentation, Field Trial, Build Request, Product Certification, Label Change, PCB
- **Labels:** bug, documentation, duplicate, enhancement, good first issue, help wanted, invalid, question, wontfix

These are mirrored as TypeScript const arrays in `src/types/task.ts`. Update
both places if the SharePoint choices change.

## The Communication field

A single string field on each task containing the entire comment thread.
Format (one record per comment, concatenated with no extra delimiter):

```
MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS AM/PM|||Author Name|||author.email@domain|||<html>
```

- `parseCommunication()` splits it into `Comment[]` (newest first).
- `appendComment()` adds a new record to the end and returns the new full string.

When the user posts a comment, we fetch the current Communication value,
append, and PATCH it back as a single field update.

## Person fields

Person-or-group fields (`Assigned`, `Watchers`) come back in different shapes
depending on whether the column is single- or multi-person:

```ts
// Single
{ LookupId: 46, LookupValue: "Sarah Shaffer", Email: "..." }

// Multi
[ { LookupId: 46, ... }, { LookupId: 87, ... } ]
```

`parsePersonField()` in `taskMapper.ts` normalises to `Person[]` either way.

For writing: SharePoint person fields go in via `LookupId` only.

- **Single-person:** `{ "TesterLookupId": 46 }` — just the integer.
- **Multi-person:** `{ "AssignedLookupId@odata.type": "Collection(Edm.Int32)", "AssignedLookupId": [46, 87] }` — the **two-key** shape Graph v1.0 demands. The plain array (without the `@odata.type` annotation) and the older `{ results: [...] }` envelope both return a useless 400 invalidRequest.

**Always go through the helper.** `src/lib/graphFields.ts` exports `multiPersonField(fieldName, people)` and `multiLookupField(fieldName, ids)` — they emit the correct two-key shape every time. Don't hand-build the payload elsewhere; you will forget the annotation and lose hours debugging the same 400.

## Parent project resolution

The `Parent_x0020_Project_x0020_ReferLookupId` field is a SharePoint lookup
into another list — the "Projects" list — which we haven't identified yet.

To find its list ID, run in PowerShell:

```powershell
$siteId = "coopermachineryservices.sharepoint.com,ddb5fc80-ea51-4d56-b008-ce6a82af49b0,aa6b9467-3f57-4213-bbd4-60b94403421a"
$listId = "42fb8c19-5f33-4fdd-9ef7-df6f21433588"

$cols = Invoke-MgGraphRequest -Method GET `
  -Uri "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/sites/$siteId/lists/$listId/columns"

$cols.value | Where-Object { $_.ContainsKey('lookup') } | ForEach-Object {
    "=== $($_['displayName']) ==="
    "  Target list ID: $($_['lookup']['listId'])"
    "  Column shown:   $($_['lookup']['columnName'])"
}
```

Paste the target list ID into `.env.local` as `VITE_SP_PROJECTS_LIST_ID`.
Once set, `listProjects()` in `tasks.ts` will resolve project names; without
it, project lookups show as empty strings.

## SharePoint identifiers

Already confirmed (don't change without re-verifying):

- **Tenant ID:** `bde86e02-c641-4952-97f2-99ea6d9b8e29`
- **Site ID:** `coopermachineryservices.sharepoint.com,ddb5fc80-ea51-4d56-b008-ce6a82af49b0,aa6b9467-3f57-4213-bbd4-60b94403421a`
- **Site URL:** <https://coopermachineryservices.sharepoint.com/sites/Altronic_Engineering>
- **Task List ID:** `42fb8c19-5f33-4fdd-9ef7-df6f21433588`
- **Task List name:** Project Task List
- **Projects List ID:** `6280c711-14f6-4546-b730-8781b9d3c960` (env: `VITE_SP_PROJECTS_LIST_ID`)
- **Test Results List ID:** `52173cd3-74ca-4d30-95c4-7a6b2d765edc` (env: `VITE_SP_TEST_RESULTS_LIST_ID`) — drives the Test Sheets view and the "Create Test Sheet" button on tasks. Both Project Reference and Task Reference columns point back to the lists above, so creating from a task is just two `LookupId` writes.
- **EIRs List ID:** `8d00a762-288c-4678-afc4-cba2f24ac965` (env: `VITE_SP_EIRS_LIST_ID`) — Engineering Information Request list. Has its own Status / Resolution / Request Type workflows + a Communication field for comments. Project Reference is a lookup to the same Projects list; Task Reference is free-text. See `src/lib/eirMapper.ts` for the field-name quirks (`MFGP_x002f_N`, `Current_x0020_Price`, truncated `Requested_x0020_Completion_x0020`, the `Priority` choice column vs `Priority0` numeric column).
- **EIR Roles List ID** (env: `VITE_SP_EIR_ROLES_LIST_ID`) — admin-managed list (Title = email, plus `DisplayName`, `Note`, and `Roles` text columns). `Roles` holds a lowercase CSV of role tags (`engineer`, `supply chain`). Gates which EIR fields a user may edit (see "EIR field permissions" below). Not yet created — set the env var once the list exists. Managed at `/admin/eir-roles`.
- **Shared mailbox** (env: `VITE_SHARED_MAILBOX`) — email address that @-mention notifications send FROM. See setup below.
- **App manager email** (env: `VITE_APP_MANAGER_EMAIL`) — recipient of "Report issue" reports sent from the life-buoy button in the header. Falls back to `ray.white@altronic-llc.com` if unset, so the button works on day one. Sent FROM the same shared mailbox, with the reporter CC'd. See `src/api/errorReport.ts`.

## EIR field permissions (roles)

Two EIR fields are edit-gated by role tags from the **EIR Roles** list:

- **Engineering Response** → requires the `engineer` role.
- **Buyer Code** → requires the `supply chain` role.

Every other EIR field stays editable by any signed-in user. A user can hold
both roles. This is **UI-level gating only** — it disables/locks the controls;
it is not a server-side security boundary (a user with SharePoint write access
could still edit the column directly in SharePoint).

Pieces:

- `src/api/eirRoles.ts` + `src/hooks/useEirRoles.ts` — CRUD over the EIR Roles
  list (mock + real), mirroring the Admins feature. `useMyEirRoles()` resolves
  the current user's `{ isEngineer, isSupplyChain, enforced }`.
- `src/views/AdminEirRolesView.tsx` (`/admin/eir-roles`) — admin-gated UI to
  tag users. Only admins (`useIsAdmin`) can modify it.
- The field→role map lives **inline in `src/views/EirDetailView.tsx`**: the
  `EditableTextCard`/`InlineTextField` helpers take a `disabled`/`disabledHint`
  prop, and the view passes `enforced && !isEngineer` / `enforced && !isSupplyChain`.
  To gate another field, add the same `disabled` prop where it's rendered.
- **Lockout safety:** `EIR_ROLES_ENFORCED` (in `src/api/config.ts`) is
  `USE_MOCK || !!SP_EIR_ROLES_LIST_ID`. In real mode, until the list is
  configured, gating is OFF so nobody is locked out. Admins are NOT auto-granted
  roles — they must add themselves to the EIR Roles list to edit gated fields.

## @-mention email notifications

When a user posts a comment with `@SomeoneName` chips (picked from the mention dropdown in CommentComposer), the app POSTs `/users/{shared-mailbox}/sendMail` for each mentioned person. The mail comes from the configured shared mailbox via Send-As, so every recipient sees a consistent "From" address rather than the sender's personal mailbox.

**One-time setup for the shared mailbox (Exchange admin task):**

1. Create the shared mailbox in the Exchange admin centre (e.g. `engineering-tasks@altronic-llc.com`).
2. Under **Mailbox delegation → Send As**, add every user who can post comments.
3. In the Entra ID app registration, ensure `Mail.Send.Shared` is included in the requested scopes (already in `src/auth/msalConfig.ts`). The first user to send mail will trigger an admin-consent prompt for this scope — an admin needs to consent.
4. Set the repo variable `VITE_SHARED_MAILBOX` to the mailbox address.

If `VITE_SHARED_MAILBOX` is unset, the app falls back to a console.warn (real mode) or console.info (mock mode) — no mail goes out, comments still post normally.

## Theming

Two themes, light and dark, controlled by a `.dark` class on `<html>`.
All colours flow through CSS variables defined in `src/styles/globals.css`
and exposed to Tailwind as `bg-bg`, `text-fg`, `border-border`, etc.
Adding a new colour means adding a CSS var first and then a Tailwind alias.

The accent colour is Cooper Red (`#CB2C30`). Cooper brand secondary colours
are available as Tailwind classes (`text-cooper-green`, `bg-ajax-yellow`, etc.).

## Common changes — recipes

### Add a new field to display on the task card

1. Confirm it exists on the SharePoint column list (PowerShell discovery).
2. Add the property to the `Task` interface in `src/types/task.ts`.
3. Map it in `toTask()` in `src/lib/taskMapper.ts`.
4. Add it to the mock fixtures in `src/data/mockData.ts`.
5. Use it in `TaskRow.tsx`, `KanbanCard.tsx`, or `DetailView.tsx`.

### Add a new mutation (e.g. update priority)

1. Add the function to `src/api/tasks.ts` (mock + real branches).
2. Add a React Query hook in `src/hooks/useTasks.ts`.
3. Use it from the relevant component.

### Add a new view

1. Create the view component in `src/views/`.
2. Add a `<Route>` in `src/App.tsx`.
3. Add a nav link in `src/components/Header.tsx`.
4. **Update the system-flow diagram in `src/views/AboutView.tsx`** so the
   new view appears in the architectural overview. See the rule below.

### Hook up the Header view switcher to add more views

Add another `<Link>` block in `src/components/Header.tsx`, matching the
pattern of the existing List and Kanban links.

### Architectural changes — REQUIRED: update the About page diagrams

`src/views/AboutView.tsx` is the in-app README. It renders two diagrams,
hand-built as React/SVG (we used to use Mermaid; replaced it because the
parser kept choking on edge cases):

1. **System flow** — defined by the `SYSTEM_TIERS` array near the top.
   Vertical tiers (User → React SPA → Auth & transport → SharePoint
   lists) with colour-coded chips.
2. **Data model** — a real ER diagram drawn on an SVG canvas. Tables
   come from the `SCHEMA_TABLES` array (each entry has hand-tuned
   `x` / `y` / `width` + columns); foreign-key relationships come from
   the `CONNECTIONS` array with crow's-foot cardinality. Both are at the
   top of `AboutView.tsx`.

**Anything that's structurally visible to a user belongs in these
diagrams. That means update the data at the top of `AboutView.tsx` in
the SAME commit when you:**

- Add or rename a route / view → add it to `SYSTEM_TIERS[].nodes`.
- Add a new hook category (e.g. `useTestSheets`, `useProjects`) → add it
  to the React SPA tier's Hooks chip.
- Add a new module in `src/api/` (e.g. a third SharePoint list API) → add
  it to the React SPA tier's API chip.
- Add a new SharePoint list → add a `SCHEMA_TABLES` entry with position
  + columns, AND add it to the SharePoint lists tier in `SYSTEM_TIERS`.
- Add a new column on an existing entity → add a row in that table's
  `columns` array (mind the height — neighbour positions may need a
  small `y` bump if the new column pushes the bottom edge into another
  table).
- Add a new foreign-key relationship between lists → add a `CONNECTIONS`
  entry with the FK column / target / cardinality.

Tip when positioning tables: each row is `ROW_HEIGHT` (22px) tall and the
header is `HEADER_HEIGHT` (50px). Total table height = HEADER + rows*22
+ ~6px padding — use that to budget vertical space between cards.

No code-review hand-wringing, no separate ticket — just edit the arrays
in the same commit. The footer "About" link is the source of truth that
new team members see when they want to understand the system.

### User-visible changes — REQUIRED: update the user manual

`src/views/ManualView.tsx` is the in-app User Manual end users see when
they click "User Manual" on the About page. Like the About diagrams, it
goes stale fast if we don't maintain it deliberately.

**Update the manual in the same commit when you:**

- Add a user-facing feature (new view, new form, new toolbar action).
- Change how an existing feature works (rename a field, move a button,
  change a default).
- Add/remove a keyboard shortcut.
- Change a notification path (email recipients, who gets pinged, etc.).
- Modify the filter / search semantics.

Sections in the manual are organised by user task — drop additions into
the right section rather than starting new ones. Keep section ids stable
so external links don't break. Tone: declarative, present-tense, "you do
X to get Y." Skip implementation detail.

## Attachments

Tasks store every uploaded file in TWO places at once. This is intentional —
the two storages serve different purposes and the redundancy is by design.

### 1. Project folder (Documents library)

Files land in `General/Project Folders/<Project Folder>/` on the site's
default Documents library. Each project folder carries a `Project Reference`
lookup metadata column tied to the Projects list — that's how the app
finds the right folder for a task's project. If no folder matches the
task's project, the file goes into a `Miscellaneous` folder with the
project code prefixed onto the filename so it stays findable by search.

Comment attachments use this path EXCLUSIVELY (they end up as
hyperlinks inlined into the comment body HTML, so there's no list-item
to attach them to).

Code: `src/api/projectFiles.ts`, hooks in `src/hooks/useTaskFiles.ts`.
Auth: standard Graph `Sites.Selected` — no extra scope needed.

### 2. SharePoint list-item attachment (SP REST)

Same file ALSO gets posted to the task list-item via the SharePoint REST
endpoint `/_api/web/lists(guid'<list-id>')/items(<id>)/AttachmentFiles`.
This makes the file visible inline on the task in the native SharePoint UI
and in any downstream automation that reads list-item attachments.

This path is **best-effort** — if the user's tenant hasn't admin-consented
to `AllSites.Manage` (Office 365 SharePoint Online), or `VITE_SP_SITE_URL`
isn't set, the list-item upload silently no-ops and the project-folder
copy still goes through. The mutation `useUploadTaskFile` always returns
the project-folder result so callers (incl. the comment composer) keep
working uniformly.

Code: `src/api/attachments.ts` (parametrised over `"task" | "eir"`).

### UI layout

The Attachments card on the task detail view shows two sub-lists:

1. **On this task (N)** — task-specific list-item attachments. Shown first
   because they're specific to this task vs. shared across the project.
2. **From `<folder name>` (N)** — project-folder files. Shown second.

Deletes are scoped per-storage — removing a file from "On this task" only
deletes the list-item attachment; removing from the project folder only
deletes the file in SharePoint. The other copy is untouched. This is by
design: users may want one but not the other to disappear.

### Adding a new attachment-related field

If you add a new attachment field to either entity, update:
1. `src/api/attachments.ts` (list-item path) or `src/api/projectFiles.ts`
   (project folder path), depending on which storage it lives on.
2. The Attachment table in `SCHEMA_TABLES` and any new connection in
   `CONNECTIONS` in `src/views/AboutView.tsx`.
3. The Attachments section in `src/views/ManualView.tsx`.
4. The changelog + this section.

## Known limitations / TODO

- **Person picker (write):** Assigning users isn't wired up — currently the
  detail view only edits Status. Adding it requires writing to the
  `AssignedLookupId` field (see "Person fields" above).
- **Rich-text comment editor:** The composer is plain text wrapped in `<p>`
  tags. The Power Apps version uses a full WYSIWYG. If you want feature
  parity, swap `CommentComposer.tsx` for a Tiptap-based editor.
- **Attachments — dual routing:** Tasks store uploads in TWO places at once
  (best-effort on the list-item side, source-of-truth on the project folder
  side). See **Attachments** section below for the full picture.
- **Workflow buttons** (New Test, New Field Trial, Form E028, Form E029)
  from the original app are intentionally not implemented in the MVP.
- **Parent project resolution:** Needs the projects list ID
  (`VITE_SP_PROJECTS_LIST_ID`) — currently falls back to empty title until set.

## Testing standard

**This project targets 100% unit-test coverage** — lib, api, hooks, components,
and views. Every change ships with tests for the code being added or modified.
See `src/test/` for the runner setup (Vitest + React Testing Library +
jsdom + a shared provider wrapper at `src/test/render.tsx`).

Test files live next to source: `foo.ts` → `foo.test.ts`,
`Bar.tsx` → `Bar.test.tsx`. Coverage thresholds in `vite.config.ts` are
currently off pending a backfill of the existing codebase; once that lands,
they'll be flipped to 100% across the board and gate CI.

## Testing checklist when you change things

After any non-trivial change:

1. `npm run typecheck` — no TS errors
2. `npm run test` — full unit suite green
3. `npm run dev` — app loads with mock data, no console errors
4. Click around all three views (list, kanban, detail)
5. Try drag-and-drop on the Kanban (a card should move and persist)
6. Try adding a comment (it should appear at the top of the thread)
7. Toggle the theme (everything should re-skin cleanly)
8. `npm run build` — production build succeeds

For real-mode testing, set `VITE_USE_MOCK=false` and confirm:
- Login pops up on first navigation
- List loads from Graph
- A drag-and-drop status change persists in SharePoint
- A new comment appears in SharePoint when viewed in the original app
