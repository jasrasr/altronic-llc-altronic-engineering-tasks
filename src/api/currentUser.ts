/**
 * Resolve the signed-in user's SharePoint user lookupId for the site.
 *
 * Why this exists: when we write to person fields (Assigned, Watchers), the
 * Graph API expects an integer lookupId, not an email. The signed-in user's
 * Entra ID account doesn't include this — it's a per-site mapping stored in
 * the hidden "User Information List" that every SharePoint site keeps.
 *
 * Strategy:
 *   1. Query the site's User Information List for an entry where
 *      EMail matches the signed-in user's UPN.
 *   2. Return that item's ID (which IS the site user lookupId).
 *   3. Fallback to 0 if we can't find a match (and log a warning so the
 *      problem is visible in DevTools rather than silent).
 *
 * The result should be cached for the session — the lookupId never changes
 * for a given user on a given site. See useCurrentUser.ts which calls this
 * once and memoises.
