// =============================================================================
// Application changelog.
//
// HOW TO UPDATE: When making a meaningful user-visible change, add a new
// entry to the TOP of this array (newest first). Bump the version using
// semver-lite rules:
//   - MAJOR (1.x.x → 2.0.0): big rework, breaking changes to data model
//   - MINOR (0.1.x → 0.2.0): new feature (Kanban view, comment editor, etc.)
//   - PATCH (0.1.0 → 0.1.1): bug fix, copy change, small UI polish
//
// Keep entries succinct — one line each, written from the user's POV.
// Group related changes under one version.

      "New Admin → EIR Roles page (/admin/eir-roles) where admins tag users as Engineer and/or Supply Chain. Only admins can manage the list",
      "EIR fields are now permission-gated: only Engineers can edit an EIR's Engineering Response, and only Supply Chain can edit the Buyer Code. Everyone else can still edit every other EIR field. Locked fields show a small lock icon explaining which role is needed",
      "Gating stays off until the EIR Roles list is set up in SharePoint, so nothing changes for existing users until an admin configures it",

    date: "2026-06-01",
    changes: [
      "On an EIR, the Project Reference field now lists each selected project on its own line with a ✕ to remove it, instead of collapsing to 'First +N' — so you can see everything assigned at a glance. Click 'Add / edit' to change the selection",

The signed-in user's SharePoint LookupId is resolved by three different components on mount (DetailView, CommentComposer, Header) and each was firing its own Graph token request in parallel. MSAL only allows one interactive auth at a time, so the 2nd/3rd hit `interaction_in_progress` and the popup fallback got blocked. Concurrent callers now share a single in-flight promise per email — one Graph call instead of three, no popup fights.",

Now the maintainer always gets the report, even when the Exchange config is broken for the signed-in user",
