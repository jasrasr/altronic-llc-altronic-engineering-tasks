        <H3>What's on the list</H3>

          The checklist covers everything from pulling new schematic / PCB
          part numbers, placing backups on the archive server, comparing
          BOM with SAP, outputting BOM + 3D model + gerber files, sending
          to CAD, submitting the build request, and the ordering /
          pre-release vs released documentation flow. The radio groups
          (Schematic and PCB revision, Send Gerber Package, Order_Parts)
          let you pick the right path through SharePoint's allowed choice
          values for that column.

        <P>
          A small <strong>done / total</strong> counter in the card header
          shows how many items are checked or chosen out of the total —
          useful for confirming you've completed everything before
          submitting a board build, and for skimming an existing PCB task
          to see if it's done.
        </P>
        <H3>Saving</H3>
        <P>
          Every checkbox flip and radio change writes to SharePoint
          immediately — optimistic, so the UI updates instantly. If the
          save fails on the network round-trip, the field flips back and
          a red toast shows the error. The standard undo lives in the
          toast for a few seconds in case you bumped a box by accident.
        </P>
        <Tip>
          If a checklist row shows a red "column missing on the
          SharePoint Task list" note, that specific SharePoint column was
          renamed or deleted — the rest of the checklist still works;
          flag the missing column to an admin so it can be restored.

            <strong>On this task</strong> — task-specific list-item

            <strong>View all in SharePoint →</strong> link at the bottom
            opens the full folder so you can browse the rest, including

        <H3>Uploading a file</H3>
        <P>
          Open the task and use the <strong>Add file</strong> button on the
          Attachments card. The file uploads to both storages in the same
          click. If your tenant isn't fully wired up for the list-item path
          (the SharePoint admin hasn't granted the SP REST scope), the
          project-folder copy still goes through and the file shows up
          there — uploads never silently fail.
        </P>
        <P>
          Project-folder routing: the app picks the folder tagged with your
          task's <strong>Project Reference</strong>. If no folder matches,
          the file lands in the shared <code>Miscellaneous</code> folder
          with the project code prepended onto the filename (e.g.{" "}
          <code>349-MT-ACI_drawing.pdf</code>) so it stays findable by
          search.
        </P>
        <H3>Removing a file</H3>
        <P>
          The trash icon next to each filename deletes <em>only that
          copy</em>. Removing a file from "On this task" doesn't touch the
          project folder; removing from the project folder doesn't touch
          the task. Each list has its own scoped delete confirmation so
          there's no surprise.
        </P>
        <H3>Comment attachments</H3>
        <P>
          Files dropped into a task comment use the project-folder path
          only — they end up as clickable hyperlinks inlined into the
          comment body (`📎 filename.pdf`). No list-item attachment is
          created for comment files, because the hyperlink in the comment
          is already the durable reference.
        </P>
        <H3>Limits</H3>
        <P>
          Files up to 4 MB upload directly. Above that, large-file upload
          sessions aren't wired up yet — drop the file into SharePoint
          directly and it'll show up on the next refresh.
        </P>
        <Tip>
          EIRs still use a list-item-only model for now (attached to the
          EIR itself, no project folder mirroring). The migration to the
          same dual-routing model is on the backlog.

          row with the numbered title on the left and the task's current
          status badge on the right, identical in feel to the Child Tasks
          card on the task detail. Hit <strong>Edit</strong> in the card
          header to type a new reference (e.g. <code>T115</code>) or paste a
          Power Apps task URL; the app extracts the task ID either way.

          EIRs have an <strong>Attachments</strong> card on the detail
          page that stores files directly against the SharePoint list
          item (the classic AttachmentFiles endpoint). If the section
          shows an "unavailable" notice, an admin still needs to grant
          the app the SharePoint REST permission (Office 365 SharePoint
          Online → AllSites.Manage). Task attachments use a different
          routing — see the "Task attachments" section.

          restricted EIR fields. Add a user, then tick <strong>Engineer</strong>{" "}
          (lets them edit an EIR's <strong>Engineering Response</strong>) and/or{" "}
          <strong>Supply Chain</strong> (lets them edit the{" "}
          <strong>Buyer Code</strong>). A user can hold both. Everyone signed in
          can still edit every other EIR field — only those two are gated. The
          checkboxes save instantly; remove a user to drop all their EIR roles.
        </P>
        <P>
          On the EIR itself, a locked field shows a small lock icon and a
          tooltip explaining which role is required. Until the EIR Roles list is
          set up in SharePoint (real mode), gating stays off and everyone can
          edit both fields.

        <Tip>
          If you're trying to add yourself and the modal closes silently with
          no row appearing, the SharePoint Admins list isn't configured yet —
          a yellow notice at the top of the Admins page tells you so. An
          admin needs to create the list and set <code>VITE_SP_ADMINS_LIST_ID</code>.

          Usually a sign-in / permission issue. F12 → Console: a 401 means
          your token expired (sign out + sign in). A 403 means the app
          doesn't have read access to the SharePoint site — talk to IT.

          If the toast turned red, the SharePoint write was rejected — open
          the task again to confirm. If the toast was green but the change
          reverted on refresh, someone else may have changed the same field
          at the same time; reapply your change.

          The default Assigned filter is set to your email. If you created a
          task for someone else, it won't appear in the default list view —
          pick "Anyone" in the Assigned filter, or change the URL's{" "}
          <code>assigned</code> parameter.

            You typed <code>@Name</code> manually instead of picking from the
            dropdown — without selecting a person from the menu, the chip's{" "}
            <code>data-email</code> is missing and the email path skips it.

          <LI>
            The recipient's email is spelled differently in SharePoint than
            the user expects. Pick them from the dropdown to make sure the
            address is right.

          <LI>
            The shared mailbox setup or Send-As permission isn't fully done

        <P>
          Click the <strong>Report issue</strong> button (life-buoy icon) in
          the top right of every page. It opens a small form where you can
          describe what went wrong. The app attaches every console error it
          has seen during your session — you don't need to open DevTools
          yourself. The report is emailed to the app maintainer with you
          CC'd, so you have a paper trail of exactly what was sent.
        </P>
        <P>
          The maintainer contact is also in the footer if you'd rather send
          a screenshot directly.
